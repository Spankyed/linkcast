# Linkcast
> A chrome extension to share links!

Linkcast is a chrome extension which organises your links and facilitates sharing. It allows you to create groups (public/private) and post relevant links in relevant groups. Other users can collaborate by joining those groups depending on the type of the group and the permission. 

## How is it different from bookmarks ?
Bookmarks doesnt allow you to collaborate and neither does it allow you to express. With Linkcast you get all the features of bookmarks and also can comment on links. You receive notifications on new links, comments, likes, etc.
